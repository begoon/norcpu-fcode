A crackme demo program based NORCPU and using Forth code as a low-level assembler.

Sources are purely for DOS and require TASMX/TLINK to build. Also it requires
Turbo Pascal 5.+ (TPC.EXE) to build the preprocessor (PRE.EXE).

Some files had been converted to UTF-8.

This project has a continuation in [NORCPU Python][] and [NORCPU Ruby][] projects.

[F-CODE][] which used as a low-level assembler is put in a separate project.
